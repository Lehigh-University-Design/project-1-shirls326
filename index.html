                    Tim Berners-Lee, a computer scientist, pioneered the development of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) as the inaugural markup language. Introduced to facilitate internet content creation, HTML structures web documents by using tags to define elements like headings and links.
                    Berners-Lee's innovation laid the foundation for the World Wide Web, 
                    enabling the seamless exchange of information online.
